# asus-fan-curve-ps
powershell script for setting a fan curve for asus laptops that don't have modes

# why
made using the fan control application at https://github.com/Karmel0x/AsusFanControl, since the author didn't need 
fan curves but I did. 

i may add new features that are useless in the future.

# usage
extract the zip and run the bat file inside it, doesn't need admin.
you can adjust and add temp thresholds and fan speeds in the powershell script.

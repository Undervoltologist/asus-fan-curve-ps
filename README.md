# asus-fan-curve-ps
powershell script for setting a fan curve for asus laptops that don't have modes

# why
made using the fan control application at https://github.com/Karmel0x/AsusFanControl, since the author didn't need 
fan curves but I did. 

i may add new features that are useless in the future.

# usage
extract the zip and run the bat file inside it, doesn't need admin.
you can adjust and add temp thresholds and fan speeds in the powershell script.
(only reacts to CPU temp)

# compatibility
if your asus laptop has a fan health test in the myasus app, this will probably work.
